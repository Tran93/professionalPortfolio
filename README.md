Challenge #2 Homework
In this challenge, I created a website from scratch with the content of being my portfolio. 

Description
I made box styles with css, with a title attached. The box titles are offset on desktop applications, and are centered in mobile applications. This is an example of me understanding viewports, and approaching content creation with a "mobile-first" approach. All links are working, anchoring to the correct section. Images are zoomed when hovered over in the "My Projects" section.
